"-- MESA asked analogous questions about self-reported experiences of discrimination in relation to specified domains only in Exam 1 (2000-2002), i.e., 10 years earlier than Exam 5, for which they employed the Major Discrimination Scale (MDS), which asks about experiences of discrimination (ever) in 6 domains (unfairly fired or denied promotion; unfairly not hired; stopped, searched, questioned, physically threatened or abused by the police; discouraged by a teacher or advisor from continuing your education; prevented from moving into a neighborhood by landlord or realtor; moved into neighborhood where neighbors made life difficult for your family) and for each question asked people to choose the “main” reason for this unfair treatment (race or ethnicity; gender; age; religion; physical appearance; sexual orientation; income level/social class; other) [sources: Williams DR, Yan Yu, Jackson JS, Anderson NB.
