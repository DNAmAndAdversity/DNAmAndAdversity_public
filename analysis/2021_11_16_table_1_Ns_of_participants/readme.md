# Create Table 1, Characteristics of MBMS and MESA Epigenetics Sampled Participants

This project implements the construction (out of a table shell) of 
an Excel table designed to serve as Table 1 of our manuscript on 
the epigenetic clocks association with social exposures. 

We have done prior work on drafting table 1 which was gender stratified,
however the gender differences did not appear large and we have chosen 
here to aggregate the genders to simplify the table. 

Emphases in these table include: 

  - Describing the counts of participants in each social exposure category;
  - Readability (users should be able to discern units, time-frames, and
    sources of each measure)
